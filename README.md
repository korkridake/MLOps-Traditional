# Practical MLOps with GitHub Actions (Classical ML)

Welcome to the Practical MLOps with GitHub Actions repository! This project is intended to serve as the starting point for MLOps implementation in Azure, with a focus on classification problems. 

## Project overview

The solution accelerator provides a modular end-to-end approach for MLOps in Azure based on pattern architectures. As each organization is unique, solutions will often need to be customized to fit the organization's needs.

The solution accelerator goals are:

- Simplicity
- Modularity
- Repeatability & Security
- Collaboration
- Enterprise readiness

It accomplishes these goals with a template-based approach for end-to-end data science, driving operational efficiency at each stage. You should be able to get up and running with the solution accelerator in a few hours.
